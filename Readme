NOTE : WE ARE HAVING ISSUES WHILE RUNNING THE "createDummyPages(bm, 10000)". This is because of the value 10000 that is passed. The program runs perfectly well with "createDummyPages(bm, 22)". While checking for the functionalities that lie below createDummyPages(bm, 10000), please do comment createDummyPages(bm, 10000). The LRU and FIFO works fine.
